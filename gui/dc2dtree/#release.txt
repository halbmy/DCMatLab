* fixed vtk export of the model
version 0.9.1 (25.05.07)
* minor bug fixes
version 0.9.0 (24.04.07)
* new feature: batch mode inverts all files in a given folder automatically
* new feature: probe line displays resistivity curve along line
* new feature: timelapse pick cell displays cell resistivity change
version 0.8.6 (12.04.07)
* improvements in time lapse inversion (for bad data with wrong signs)
* took out automatic neglection of big derivations is time lapse data
* solved problem with blanks and + signs in directory name
version 0.8.5 (16.10.06)
* displays electrode numbers after prepare (validation)
* now asks for direction of electrodes for ddz files
* sorting of the timelapse files according file time
* now uses lambda from GUI for timelapse (no run necessary)
version 0.8.4 (12.09.06 hotfix)
* fixed minor bugs in combination with time lapse inversion
* note: time lapse is still not a full feature and thus experimental
version 0.8.3 (01.09.06)
* fixed bug in timelapse times and export of png files
* fixed bug in sorting electrodes (e.g. by use of dummy electrodes)
* fixed bug with wrong colorscale for non-auto color and added endpoint
version 0.8.2 (14.08.06)
* standard file now with spline boundary (call Options->Prepare default)
* fixed bug with changing radius of ddz type file
version 0.8.1 (04.07.06)
* export function (relative deviations) for timelapse results
* introduced another time lapse option (slower but handles differing data)
* standard file prepare now really works
* fixed colorbar bug (was always 1 to 10)
version 0.8.0 (13.06.06)
* reintroduced standard file (to activate, press Options->Prepare standard files once)
* disordered electrodes allowed in input files
  this allows for additional geometry points as dead electrodes after active ones
* introduced time lapse option (load data, show data, inversion)
version 0.7.0 (10.01.06)
* now really remembers last directory
* fixed error in load project
* solved problem with iteration number > 9
* introduced picking of resistivity (+phase) value (Export->Pick Cell)
* introduced export of (midpoint based) ascii file
* mesh options are now global during the DC2dTree session
* added no-spline and equal refinement to mesh options
* introduced inversion options (+constraints, +upper/lower bound, +update)
version 0.6.1 (01.11.05)
* changed default mesh options (refine=0.2/0.005, maxarea=5e-3/5e-4)
* boundary is now described by spline (smoother) -> less artifacts
* switched to smoothness constraints again (bug since 0.5.9)
* reintroduced circle prepare (saves time for circle geometry)
version 0.6.0 (25.10.05)
* enabled reading of ip data from ddz files
* changed default values for mesh generation
* switched to triangle 1.6 (smaller meshes, too large triangles?)
version 0.5.9 (03.09.05)
* displaying (random) sensitivity by Shift+S key
* switched to binary mesh (bms) format
* switched to unified data format, files without tokens are considered ohm-Files
version 0.5.8 (13.07.05)
* enabled changing the colorbar for phase model
* configuration factor (Weidelt) for arbitrary configurations
* changed the system internally
version 0.5.7 (18.04.05)
* reordered example directory
* show phase model menu item
* fixed cglscd bug for large regularization parameters
* minor bug fixes
version 0.5.6 (14.04.05)
* arbitrary electrode configurations
* robust data inversion option
* blocky model option
* preview function to checkout regularization strength
version 0.5.5 (31.03.2005)
* arbitrary electrode numbers
version 0.5.4 (15.02.2005)
* minor improvements
version 0.5.3 (12.02.2005)
* induced polarization (IP) phase inversion
version 0.5.2 (31.01.2005)
* loading of dc2dinvres style files
version 0.5.1 (10.01.2005)
* first stable release
version 0.5.0 (22.12.2004)
* first beta version (with dcfemlib 0.5.0)
