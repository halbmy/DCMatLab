CylBERT - Timelapse Boundless Electrical Resistivity Inversion on Cylinders

* read popup box content from file to easily include other geometries
* display image shot for data
* create different BS335 types, each twice with numerical/experimental k

* make a much more general inversion on any lysimeter

* generate icon file (some BGR pic)
= make dcinv showing starting resistivity and verbosing ip inversion
= display some results (chi^2/rms, min/max model)
= check for data reordering and throw away non-matching data
= make (edit and internal) fields empty when choosing the geometry type
= check error estimation
= single (null) data set must not apply -t option
= introduce optimum regularization parameter
= load new file from old directory
= correct "invalid file" bug
= bug for just one additional data set
= max error 1% active or wrong? (only measuring error=small)
