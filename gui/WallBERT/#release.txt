Authors: Thomas Günther & Carsten Rücker, resistivity.net production
------------------------------------------------------------------------

version 0.9 (13.03.08)
* save options menu item, will be read at program start
* inversion options (regularization strength, lower/upper bound, error weighting, robust/blocky)
* mesh options (mesh type, quality, maxparameter, refinement for para and prim mesh)
* updated handbook with many figures and release notes
version 0.8.3 (04.02.08)
* loads new file from same directory of old file
* bugfix: only impedance data present (modelling)
* bugfix: no ip data present in remove data
version 0.8.2 (16.01.08)
* speeded up spectral inversion
* catched negative apparent resistivities causing hang-up
version 0.8.1 (11.01.08)
* introduced checks for valid geometry and electrode numbers
* minor beautifying (colored status bar) and bug fixing
* fixed bug displaying wrong array types for 3+4 side files
* fixed bug that did not save n3/n4/d3/d4 to geometry file
version 0.8 (21.12.07) "Santa Claus"
* updated handboook
* enabled inversion for all frequencies at one time
* introduced Pick Cell: shows amplitude (and phase) spectrum
* extended model output to all available phases
version 0.7.5 (12.12.07)
* enabled export model via Export->Export Model
* added synthetic 3d example showing 3d effects
* trim now works for all frequencies 
  (but deletions are still lost when changing frequency)
* completely cleaned up code a lot (still things are not working)
version 0.7 (07.12.07)
* first version of a german handbook
* removed meshing problem with electrodes near the boundary
* solved problem with zero (or invalid) voltages in data file
* solved problem with CalcGeo producing completely wrong apparent resistivities
  (however inversion was still done correctly)
version 0.6 (22.11.07)
* cannot remember what the changes have been
version 0.5 (02.11.07)
* Save Data (File Menu) saves processed file
* set as default geometry (File Menu) will be loaded at start)
* introduced min/max trimming of data
* added statistics/histogram checkbox for data plotting
* more status messages, watch-pointer shows computation
* added Icon to installer
version 0.4 (28.10.07)
* changed order of buttons 
* used unstructured mesh for Calc Geo (much faster)
* introduced popupmenu for data viewing rhoa/IP/k/U/I
* introduced save/load geometry to *.wbg (WallBert Geometry) file
* marked geometry with colors
version 0.3.2 (26.10.07)
* introduced different mesh types and optional refinement
  (not all are guaranteed to work well)
* some more status messages, minor beautifying  
version 0.3.1 (23.10.07)
* included meshconvert into install file (was missing before)
* fixed bug in Make Mesh making 4 sides running
version 0.3 (22.10.07)
* made all input measures (l,t,a,ni,di) working
  (so far just tested for geometry case 1 - Obelix & Idefix )
* enabled 5 different geometries (opp.sides, 1/2/3/4 sides)
  sides are numbered counterclockwise, electrodes from left
* minor beautifying/bug fixing, more status messages

version 0.2 (11.10.07)
* enabled button CalcGeo (calculates primary potential/geometry factor)
  needs dcfemlib::meshconvert
* manual data edit by clicking on data blocks possible
* phase inversion (single phase, single step)

version 0.1 (05.10.07)
* first rudimentary version with main control elements
(restricted to two opposite sides, Load and invert data)
* pure resistivity inversion (based on dcfemlib2::dcinv)
