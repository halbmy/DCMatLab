Bugs & Minors:
iconify new figures
= ip not existent (modelling) -> error in data deletion
= wrong popupmenu after reading in model file
Load new data file in the folder of the current
colorbar does not disappear sometimes

Todo's for BAM release:
1.=Remove many different ohm files, Da and so on
2.=Save multifrequent files (extra column for f)
3.=SIP behaviour:
  =Make single step amplitude (reference) and ip inversion  
  =Choose frequency for plot
  =show spectrum for pick cell
4.=Export
  =Text file (midpoint, rho, phi for each phase)
  =Graphics
5.=Handbook in german
### milestone 0.8 (21.12.07) ###
   Some more images in handbook: general view, examples
6.=Check invalid geometries, datafiles and so on
7.=Do Enable/Disable again
### 0.8.3
8. Mesh Options: 
     Para: Type, Refine, Quality; 
     Prim: dx, quality (later   
9. Inversion options: Lambda, LambdaOpt, Robust, Blocky     
10. Introduce Hotkeys
### version 0.9 ####
11. optimize runtime by mesh options and so on
12. evaluate software (check default) options, remove mesh options from main window
### milestone 1.0 (January 2008) ###
very long walls: distribute marker 1 and 2, show only 2, but compute both
different a values for different sides (partly accomplished in 0.8.3)
add data in file menu
More intelligent  weighting of resistivity/phase values

### check before version 1.0 ###
reduce mesh types to the essentials (reg. rectangles + irr. triangles?)
  (maybe move mesh type into mesh options)
extensive testing with all sent files: testbox with file/geometry
find dummy user to check useability
check again all the requirements

Optional: 
Correct data by 3d potential calculation (automatised)
Full BERT behaviour:
  Save single primary potentials -> interpolate -> use in dcinv
    Create pot/sec and pot/prim in installer
    delete pot/prim/* and pot/prim/* before dcfem and interpolate
2d modelling by creating poly file    
Export results into surfer file (which one? current amplitude)

Done minors:
= Fix problem of changed electrode order using water measurement
= read in multiple frequencies from TX0 files
= introduce popdown menu for choosing frequency
= icon
= messages/status line before/after each step
= use of Watch/Arrow pointer type
= statistics checkbox next to Show switches to histogram
= min/Trim/max Edit/Buttons
= all buttons into Menu (Tag: BlaMenu)
= fix problem with tomo.bms/tomo2.bms
= enable unified data format as for res2dinv (what's with SIP then??)
= more status messages
  = min/max rhoa after calc rhoa or edit data
  = min/max rho/phase after inversion
= make opposite sides fully working
  = change d1 to be distance from electrode n to corner
  = d2 is distance from corner to electrode n+1
  = improve geometry plot (for all types)
= save data file
= save/load geometry
= Edit data (rhoa[,ip,err,u,i] >/</= value)
=  popdown menu for field
= enable other geometries
= one side
= two neighboring sides (d1,d2)
= three sides (d1, d2, d3)
= four sides (d1, d2, d3, d4)
