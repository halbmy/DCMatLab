# DCMatLab
Matlab stuff for Direct Current modelling and inversion including link to pyGIMLi

# Description
This repository bears my old Matlab codes, mainly on Modelling and Inversion of ERT data using Finite Differences. It represents the code basis of my PhD thesis (Günther, 2004). However, there are also plenty of utility functions for pyGIMLi/BERT studies described in the BERT papers (Rücker et al. 2006; Günther et al. 2006). 

Note that theses codes are outdated as we moved the development to Python long time ago. However, they might be of help for those who want to do data processing or model postprocessing with Matlab.
