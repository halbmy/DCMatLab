<h2>DC2DInvRes - Resolution Analysis Menu</h2>
<p>The SVD resolution analysis is an powerfull tool for estimating quality and 
  confidence of inversion results as well as for experimental design and the optimization 
  of model parameterization. For further information see <a href="resolution.pdf">here</a>.<br>
  By means of an example is show, how the particular quantities can be interpreted.</p>
<h3><a name="datres"></a>Data Resolution</h3>
The &quot;Data Resolution&quot; is the main diagonal of the 
  data resolution matrix. It shows, how well (and how independend from other data) 
  the particular data points can be predicted and how much information of the 
  data set comes from this measurement. The maximum of 1 is nearly reached for 
  shallow electrode configurations with small errors. Data with large errors and 
  (nearly) redundant data have small resolutions and contribute less information.

<h3><a name="modres"></a>Model Resolution</h3>
<p>The &quot;Model Resolution&quot; is the main diagonal of the model resolution 
  matrix. The value can be interpreted as reconstructability of the model cells. 
  Shallow cells have high resolution (1), resulting in a good resistivity reconstruction 
  in amplitude and shape. Deep cells and such outside of the center can't perfectly 
  be reconstructed by the inversion process. A loss in amplitude is the result 
  connected with smooth shapes.</p>

<h3><a name="resrad"></a>Resolution radius</h3>
<p>Under the assumption of approximately constant model resolution a cell can 
  be seen as an equivalent circle with the same model information. The consideration 
  of model dimensions leads to the resolution radius, which can be treated as 
  uncertainty of boundary or bodies.</p>

<h3><a name="modcov"></a>Model Cell Resolution</h3>
<p>The columns of the model resolution matrix show for each model cell, how a 
  change in resistivity is reproduced by the inversion. Shallow cells have sharp 
  cell resolutions, whereas deep cells tend to give blurred images. <br>
  The model cells can be chosen by clicking on it or by controlling the slider.<br>
  Note, that the model cell resolutions can be calculated without singular value 
  decomposition. </p>

<h3><a name="datcov"></a>Single Data Resolution</h3>
<p>The different columns of the data resolution matrix show for each datum point, 
  how well they are connected with each other. Data with the same transmittor/receiver 
  dipole usually correlate to a high degree.</p>

<h3><a name="sv"></a>Singular Values</h3>
Shows the singular values. Fast decreasing singular values show the ill-conditioning 
of the inverse problem. 
<h3><a name="filfak"></a>Filter factors and transform function</h3>
<p>Very small singular values tend to explode in the inversion, resulting in much 
  high-frequency components in the solution. Filter factors are used to prevent 
  this. Additionally, this plot shows the transform function, filter factors divided 
  by singular values, which is the main diagonal in the generalized inverse. It 
  can also be seen, how the information content is cumulated by the several singular 
  vectors.</p>

<h3><a name="clear"></a>Clear SVD</h3>
This option is used to clean any svd matrices from workspace and to force a new 
calculation, when resolution images are called.
