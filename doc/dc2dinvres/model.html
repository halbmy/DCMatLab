      <p>This dialog is used to control the model parameterizations. </p>
      <p> By typing dx a new (equidistant) x-grid is defined, which also can be 
        edited manually.<br>
        The boundaries of the model layers can be changed both manually or automatically 
        (by regarding 1D sensitivities or by constructing logarithmically increasing 
        thicknesses for a given model depth).<br>
        Furthermore, the background resistivities can be set up. In the presented 
        example a three-layer case is introduced. Note, that the number of Background 
        resistivities must equal the number of z-Layers, since the last resistivity 
        is that below the model.</p>

<h3><a name="hom"></a>Homogeneous model</h3>
<p>This resets all model cells (and background resistivities) back to the homogeneous 
  half-space of the median resistivity.</p>

<h3><a name="export"></a>Export model</h3>
<p>For further work or manual plots the model can be exported into an column-oriented 
  model file (*.mod) of the following format:</p>
<p>x_1&nbsp;&nbsp;x_2&nbsp;&nbsp;z_1 z_2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;resistivity (coverage)<br>
  ... </p>
<p>The model files can be used for postprocessing as well as for saving purposes. 
  It is recommended to save important inversion models as model file. Thus it 
  is possible to print the model at a later time.</p>
<h3><a name="import"></a>Import model</h3>
The exported model is loaded from ASCII type model file (*.mod) into workspace. 
It may be a synthetic model, a starting/reference model or a formerly save inversion 
result. 
<p></p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="comparemod"></a>Compare models</h3>
For several reasons like synthetic model studies, it might be useful to determine 
the distance of two models.<br>
After clicking, a input file dialog opens to select a model file (*.mod) on disk. 
The rms error between the current model and the model on disk is diplayed in a 
dialog.
