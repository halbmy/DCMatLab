<h2>DC2DInvRes - Inversion Menu</h2>
<h3><a name="full"></a>Full Inversion</h3>
<p>The full inversion is carried out using the current options.<br>
  Inversion stops as soon as the chi-squared misfit stagnates or the data are 
  fitted within standard deviation (chi^2&lt;1). </p>
<p><a href="hotkeys.html">Hotkey</a>: Shift+I</p>
<h3><a name="one"></a>One inverse step</h3>
<p>Only one inverse step including forward calculation is calculated. This is 
  particularly usefull for testing options as regularization types and strengths.</p>
<p><a href="hotkeys.html">Hotkey</a>: 1</p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="lay"></a>Create Layered Model</h3>
Applying a one-dimensional inversion to the whole data set a starting model is 
constructed containing the main layering of the underground. The algorithm tries 
to equalize neighboring layers if the difference is not very large. 
<h3><a name="mref"></a>Set as Reference Model</h3>
The actual model is set as reference model, which is the homogeneous starting 
model. It can be successfully applied if an a-priori model is present and the 
inversion model is forced to keep close to is. 
<h3><a name="back"></a>Back to old model</h3>
Sometimes it proves useful to play with some options using the one-step inversion. 
For that reason, it is possible to go back to the last model via this feature. 
<hr>
<h3><a name="clear"></a>Clear Sensitivity</h3>
Sometimes it is useful to clear the sensitivity matrix (for recomputation or saving 
disk space). 
<h3><a name="calc"></a>Sensitivity Integration</h3>
<p>Calculates the homogeneous half-space sensitivity matrix. Otherwise it is done 
  automatically before the first inverse step. These sensitivities are saved for 
  later use in a file with the root of the data file plus &quot;-sens.mat&quot;. 
  Once the sensitivities are calculated, they can be investigated using <a href="display.html#sens">Show 
  Sensitivities</a>.</p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="doi"></a>Display Depth of Investigation</h3>
The depth of investigation (DOI) index shows, following (Li and Oldenburg, 1999), 
the dependence on the starting model. One inversion step is carried out using 
two different homogeneous half-spaces. The difference between the two models can 
be treated as a reliability of the model cells. A well-resolved model cell is 
supposed to obtain nearly identical inversion results. 
<hr>
<h3><a name="ipinv"></a>IP Inversion </h3>
If IP data are present, a single-step is carried out following (Beard, Hohman 
and Tripp, 1996). As a result the chargeability of the model cells can be displayed 
using the <a href="display.html">Show menu</a>.
