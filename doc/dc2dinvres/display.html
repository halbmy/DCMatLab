<h2>DC2DInvRes - Show Menu</h2>
<h3><a name="model"></a>Model</h3>
The model display shows the resistivity of the model section. There are a lot 
of options for that descibed in the <a href="options.html#graph">options menue</a>. 
By clicking on model cells the cell boundaries and the resistivities are displayed. 
This mode can also be used for <a href="interact.html#model">interactive modelling</a> 
by typing a resistivity value into the edit window and clicking on model cells 
or drawing ragged boxes.

<h3><a name="cov"></a>Coverage</h3>
The Coverage is defined by the sum of the (absolute values of) 
  sensitivities over all measurements and can be displayed like a model section.<br>
<p align="center">  <img src="pic/cov.png" width="715" height="346"> </p>
<p>In analogy to ray path tomography it's something like total raypath and gives 
  information on how well the model cells are &quot;covered&quot; by the data 
  set. It is used for alpha mapping the model section to avoid over-interpretation 
  of anomalies in bad covered regions such as near the model boundaries.</p>
<p></p>
<h3><a name="sens"></a>Sensitivities</h3>
<p>Furthermore, it is possible to display the sensitivity for every single datum 
  point. A positive sensitivity(red) leads to an increased apparent resistivity 
  when the cell resistivity is rised, negative sensitivity(blue) lower the apparent 
  resistivity. The measurement is insensible to regions of zero sensitivity(white).<br>
  Regarding this we have a first concept of detectability and resolveability of 
  underground structures.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="pic/sens.png" width="715" height="346"></p>
<p>By moving the slider (or typing datum number) we can switching to all data 
  points. </p>
<h3><a name="data"></a>Display data points</h3>
To display the complete data set it is useful to plot every datum point with a 
single block. The following section shows a dipole-dipole dataset (21 electrodes, 
a=2m) dipole length as a function of midpoint&nbsp;(x) and separation (dipole 
distance by dipole length). 
<p align="center"><img src="pic/data.png" width="677" height="439"></p>
<p>By clicking on a single datum point a dialog shows its electrode positions 
  and the measured resistivity. The user is able to delete this datum point clicking 
  on &quot;yes&quot;.</p>
<p><a href="hotkeys.html">Hotkey</a>: Shift+D</p>
<h3><a name="error"></a>Error</h3>
<p>In the same manner as for plotting the data one can display the (measured or 
  estimated) standard deviations of each datum point.</p>
<h3><a name="forward"></a>Forward Response</h3>
<p>The forward response of the current model ist diplayed in the same way like 
  the data.</p>
<p><a href="hotkeys.html">Hotkey</a>: Shift+R</p>
<h3><a name="misfit"></a>Data Misfit</h3>
Watching the data misfit (difference between datum point and forward response 
in percent) it is possible to see how the data are fitted by the model. Ideally, 
the data are fitted giving a misfit of gaussian errors showing no significant 
function of space. 
<p align="center"><img src="pic/misfit.png" width="677" height="439"></p>
<h3><a name="miserr"></a>Misfit per Error</h3>
To estimate, how well the data are fitted, the misfit is divided by the standard 
deviation and plotted.<br>
Ideally, the misfit per error is (again) randomly distributed and near +/- 1 at 
the end of inversion process. 
<h3><a name="compare"></a>Compare data</h3>
To have an overview on fitting the data it is useful to see data, forward response 
and misfit in one window. Data points and forward response are plotted using the 
same colorbar. The plots are placed in a seperate window, which keeps updated 
if the model (and thus its response) is changing. It is recommended to create 
the window at the beginning of the inversion. 
<p align="center"><img src="pic/compare.png" width="568" height="504"></p>
<p><a href="hotkeys.html">Hotkey</a>: Shift+C</p>
<h3><a name="voltage"></a>Voltage</h3>
<p>If present, the measured (or in the error GUI estimated) voltage (absolute) 
  is displayed in data type (logarithmic colorbar).</p>
<h3><a name="current"></a>Current</h3>
<p>If currents are present in the data, they are displayed in mA with log-scaled 
  colors.</p>
<h3><a name="ipdata"></a>IP Data</h3>
<p>If the data file contains IP data, they can be displayed and used for inversion 
  of chargeabiliy.</p>
<h3><a name="charge"></a>Chargeability</h3>
<p>Once a chargeability model has been derived by the IP data, it can be displayed.
