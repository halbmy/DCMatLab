<h2>DC3DInvRes - Inversion Menu</h2>
<h3><a name="hom"></a>Homogeneous model</h3>
<p>This resets all model cells (and background resistivities) back to the homogeneous 
  half-space.</p>
<p align="right">Hotkey for homogeneous model: Shift + H</p>
<h3><a name="lay"></a>Create layered model</h3>
Applying a one-dimensional inversion of the whole data set a starting model is 
constructed containing the main layering of the underground. The algorithm tries 
to equalize neighboring layers if the difference is not very large. 
<h3></h3>
<h3><a name="full"></a>Full Inversion</h3>
<p>The full inversion is carried out using the current options.<br>
  Inversion stops when the difference between data and forward response is not 
  significantly getting better or when the data are fitted within standard deviation. 
</p>
<p align="right">Hotkey for full inversion: Shift + I</p>
<h3><a name="one"></a>One inverse step</h3>
<p>Only one inverse step (with forward calculation) is calculated (useful for 
  testing).</p>
<p align="right">Hotkey for one inverse step: 1</p>
<h3><a name="clear"></a>Clear Sensitivity</h3>
Sometimes it is useful to clear the sensitivity matrix (for recomputation or saving 
disk space). 
<h3><a name="calc"></a>Calc Sensitivity</h3>
<p>Calculates the (homogeneous half-space) sensitivity matrix (otherwise it is 
  done automatically before the first inverse step). These sensitivities are (automatically) 
  saved in a file with the root of the data file plus &quot;-sens.mat&quot;. Note, 
  that every single sensitivity can be viewed by <a href="display.html#sens">Show 
  Sensitivies</a>.</p>
<h3><a name="doi"></a>Display depth of investigation</h3>
The depth of investigation (DOI) index shows, following (Li and Oldenburgh, 1999), 
the dependence on the starting model. One inversion step is carried out using 
two different homogeneous half-spaces. The difference between the two models can 
be treated as a reliability of the model cells. A well-resolved model cell is 
supposed to obtain nearly identical inversion results. 
<h3><a name="showlcurve"></a>Show L-curve</h3>
<p>If an equation solver for multiple lambda values was applied (Manual Choosing 
  or L-curve choosing in <a href="options.html#inv">Inversion Options</a>), the 
  according L-curve is displayed.</p>
<h3><a name="ipinv"></a>IP Inversion</h3>
<p>A single-step inversion follwing (Beard, Hohmann and Tripp, 1996) is carried 
  out to obtain a chargeability distribution.</p>
